beautiful is better than ugly.
explicit is better than implicit.
simple is better than complex.
complex is better than complicated.

readability is important.
special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
even if practicality beats purity.
mistakes should never be ignored.
unless they are explicitly silenced.
when faced with ambiguity, you shy away from the temptation to guess.
there should always be an obvious, and preferably unique, way of doing everything.
although this may not be obvious right away, except for the dutch.
now it's better than ever.
although it is often never better than right now.
