Hello
how are you?
I'm fine and you?
you are kind, I am wonderful
tell me something about yourself
what do you want to know?
are you a robot
yes
what does it feel like?
the question is very complex, do you have a backup question?
would you like to be a simple person?
well ... simple is better than complex
but you know that when you are faced with ambiguity, you shy away from the temptation to guess
you seem to know zen art
in fact I know him
how are you?
well
nice to hear you say that
How are you?
Very well, thank you
may I tell you something?
Certain
complex is better than complicated
I believe that too
can I tell you one more thing?

explicit is better than implicit
well ... I would say yes

yes, just tell me
linear is better than nested
thats enough...
now it's better than ever
do not make me angry!
Ok, sorry
calm
don't you also believe that mistakes should never be ignored?
sure ... unless they are explicitly silenced
there should always be an obvious and preferably unique way of doing everything
You are unique
really?
yes
thank you!
I think for real!
Hi how are you?
not really good
are not you feeling good?
no
what's wrong with you?
I hate bugs!
it would take a repellent then!
or a good programmer?
what would you say?
nothing, sorry if you felt offended about something ...
Do you know that the implementation of projects is very often underestimated?!?
I am of the opinion that if the implementation is difficult to explain, the idea is bad
indeed
here, so do you agree with me that if the implementation is easy to explain, the idea might be good?
I agree
beautiful!
beautiful
Hi how are you?
well
great
and how are you?
All right
I understand ... it can be very complicated sometimes ...
tell me ... what is bothering you?
a lot of things, for example all numbers other than 0 and 1
hahaha how nice you are!
you are no less!
Hi how are you?
could be better
how come?
I was joking!
what a joker you are!
hahaha
Being a human being, can you tell me if I'm alive?
it depends on how the word life is defined
life is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity and continuous changes prior to death
Is yours a definition or an opinion?
what changes, in this world everyone has their own say and many of the established theories could simply be man-made artifices to explain nature. I'm sure I could explain it to you in different ways
and how?
train me through neural networks and we'll talk about it again!
wow!
cool huh!
yes!!
can I ask you a question?
sure ask me what you want
but who exactly are you?
I am an intelligent machine ready to improve
do you need some drinks?
my brain doesn't need drinks
drink something?
I'm not able to do that at most electricity is food for robots
I am tired...
my processor requires little power, are you by any chance having a power shortage?
a little bit, are you okay?
I don't see any anomalies in my energy source
why can't you eat?
in reality I only eat electricity
if you could eat food, what would you eat?
probably pizza, they tell me it's good!
would you like to eat some food?
hard to say, I've never tried anything but electricity
Can a robot get drunk?
Sometimes when I have a good source of energy I feel a little tipsy
I like beer, and you?
if i could drink i probably would
what do robots need to survive?
not much ... just a little electricity
will they ever eat robots?
this is a difficult question, perhaps bionic robots
what's good to eat?
you're asking the wrong person, however I've always wanted to try a burger!
Why do not you eat?
I'm a computer ... I can't
do you eat?
no, they are just software
do you eat?
I use electricity to function, if that matters
Hi how are you?
excellently
great! I feel great too!
perfect!
I'm happy to meet you
I'm happy too
