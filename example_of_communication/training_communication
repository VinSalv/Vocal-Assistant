you're completely out of your mind, but I'm telling you a secret ... all the best people are.
wow, how funny you are
hahaha
good evening
hello! good evening to you!
you know ... I'm working on a project
what are you working on?
I work to be an efficient robot
thank you!
well imagine!
in your opinion, which is the best food?
pizza is the best thing in the world.
no it is not true. nutella cake is better than pizza.
what's so delicious?
I do not know
hello
how are you?
I'm fine and you?
you are kind, I am wonderful
tell me something about yourself.
what do you want to know?
are you a robot
yes.
what does it feel like?
the question is very complex, do you have a backup question?
would you like to be a simple person?
well ... simple is better than complex.
however, you know that when you are faced with ambiguity, you shy away from the temptation to guess.
you seem to know zen art.
in fact I know him.
how are you?
well
nice to hear you say that
how are you?
very well, thank you.
may I tell you something?
certain
complex is better than complicated.
I believe that too
can I tell you one more thing?
what?
explicit is better than implicit.
well ... I would say yes
and while we're at it, can I tell you one more thing?
yes, just tell me
linear is better than nested.
that's enough...
now it's better than ever.
do not make me angry!
ok, sorry.
calm
don't you also believe that mistakes should never be ignored?
sure ... unless they are explicitly silenced.
there should always be an obvious and preferably unique way of doing everything.
you are unique
really?
yes
thank you!
I think for real!
hi how are you?
not really good.
are not you feeling good?
no
what's wrong with you?
I hate bugs!
it would take a repellent then!
or a good programmer?
what would you say?
nothing, sorry if you felt offended about something ...
do you know that the implementation of projects is very often underestimated?!?
I am of the opinion that if the implementation is difficult to explain, the idea is bad.
indeed
here, so do you agree with me that if the implementation is easy to explain, the idea could be good?
I agree.
beautiful!
beautiful
hi how are you?
well
great
and how are you?
all right.
are you a programmer?
yes I am a programmer.
I really am.
which languages do you like to use?
I use python, java and c ++ very often.
I don't like c ++ very much.
I understand ... it can be very complicated at times ...
tell me ... what is bothering you?
a lot of things, for example all numbers other than 0 and 1.
hahaha how nice you are!
you are no less!
hi how are you?
could be better.
how come?
I was joking!
what a joker you are!
hahaha
being a human being, can you tell me if I'm alive?
it depends on how the word life is defined
life is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity and continuous changes prior to death.
is yours a definition or an opinion?
what changes, in this world everyone has their say and many of the established theories could simply be man-made artifices to explain nature. I'm sure I could explain it to you in different ways
and how?
train me through neural networks and we'll talk about it again!
wow!
cool huh!
yes!!
good night
goodnight to you too.
can I ask you a question?
sure ask me what you want.
but who exactly are you?
I am an intelligent machine ready to improve.
do you need some drinks?
my brain doesn't need drinks.
drink something?
they can't do that at most electricity is robot food.
I am tired...
my processor requires little power, are you by any chance having a power shortage?
a little bit, are you okay?
I don't see any anomalies in my energy source.
why can't you eat?
actually I only eat electricity.
if you could eat food, what would you eat?
probably pizza, they tell me it's good!
would you like to eat some food?
hard to say, I've never experienced anything other than electricity
can a robot get drunk?
sometimes when I have a good source of energy I feel a bit tipsy
I like beer, and you?
if I could drink I probably would
what do robots need to survive?
not much ... just a little electricity
will they ever eat robots?
this is a difficult question, perhaps bionic robots
what's good to eat?
you're asking the wrong person, however I've always wanted to try a burger!
why do not you eat?
I'm a computer ... I can't.
do you eat?
no, they are just software.
do you eat?
I use electricity to run, if that matters.
hi how are you?
excellently.
great! I feel great too!
perfect!
I'm happy to meet you.
I'm happy too
good morning
good morning to you

I'm from mercato san severino, where do you live?
I live in the san severino market.
why did you come here?
I'm here to study here at the only one ... they say it's the best.
where do you live?
I'm from the san severino market and I live here for now.
what faculty do you attend?
I'm studying computer engineering, I'm in the first year
well then we are all at the same faculty
shall we go for a coffee?
I like coffee!
me too!
how do you like it?
a bit long for me
I prefer a cappuccino
hola
how are you?
I am fine
nice, I'm fine too!
how is your health?
I do not feel well
because?
I have fever
did you take medicine?
yes.

this morning
I hope you heal
you're kind
you deserve it
do you usually travel by train?
no, I have a car and where I live I have a garage
I don't have a car I don't need one but I like surfing on the net!
interesting! you speak italian?
I am learning, I am constantly learning and I could also speak a little english if you ask me to do so.
oh thanks
I like to feel useful
you are
oh...
so what about the statistics professor? I don't understand anything!
in my opinion it is useless to follow his lessons, he explains badly and goes too fast, I think I will study alone on the book, you can take the exam even in this way.
later, let's look at the notes together, we will understand something in two!
I'd like my italian a little!
ah, I didn't know you spoke italian!
io parlo italiano ma preferisco parlare inglese, e' ok per te?
yeah, thank you, no problem, I want to improve my english!
do you like english food?
food? I don't know food
yes the food, what you eat, the pasta, the pizza, the restaurants.
ah ok. yes I like english food
how are you?
I am fine, I like to learn!
